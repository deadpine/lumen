Exploring the connection between light and humans

# Project Summary:

Two Raspberry Pi Pico W devices connected to the internet (one in each house).

Each Pico W will be equipped with a sound sensor, a button, and an RGB LED.

When the button is pressed, the sound sensor measures the noise level, and the RGB LED changes color based on the frequency of the sound.

The action will also be mirrored on the other Raspberry Pi Pico W connected to the network, allowing both houses to see the changes.
